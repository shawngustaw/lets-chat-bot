# Let's Chat Bot

10% time project at Security Compass. If someone wanted to make a Let's Chat bot in JS (as opposed to a Hubot adapter in Coffeescript) then this is probably how you would do it. Feel free to use this a template - what's mine is yours. 

## Currently supports:

* Listing code reviews from Gitlab
* Displaying metadata about Youtube Videos
* Listing tickets in QA from Jira
